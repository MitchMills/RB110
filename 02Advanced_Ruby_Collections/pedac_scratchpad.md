# PROBLEM
Have the method letter_changes(str) take the str parameter being passed and modify it using the following algorithm:
  - Replace every letter in the string with the 3rd letter following it in the alphabet (ie. c becomes f, Z becomes C).
  - Then return this modified string.

# EXAMPLES
p letter_changes("this long cake@&") == "wklv orqj fdnh@&"
p letter_changes("Road trip9") == "Urdg wuls9"
p letter_changes("EMAILZ@gmail.com") == "HPDLOC@jpdlo.frp"
p letter_changes('xyz') == ('abc')
