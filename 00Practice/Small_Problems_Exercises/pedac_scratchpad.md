# PROBLEM
Create a method that takes two integers as arguments. The first argument is a count, and the second is the first number of a sequence that your method will create. The method should return an Array that contains the same number of elements as the count argument, while the values of each element will be multiples of the starting number.

You may assume that the count argument will always have a value of 0 or greater, while the starting number can be any integer value. If the count is 0, an empty list should be returned.

- input: two integers
  - first integer: count
    - always have a value of 0 or greater
  - second integer: starting number of sequence
    - can be any integer value, positive or negative or zero

- output: array
  - contains same number of elements as count input
  - values of each element are multiples of starting number input
  - if count input is 0, return empty array

# EXAMPLES
sequence(5, 1) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sequence(4, -7) == [-7, -14, -21, -28]
sequence(3, 0) == [0, 0, 0]
sequence(0, 1000000) == []

# DATA STRUCTURES
- input: two integers
  - range from 1 up to count
- output: array

# ALGORITHM
(- if count input is 0, return empty array)
- create a range from 1 up to count input
- iterate over range
  - transform each element by multiplying it by multiple input
  - return this array
