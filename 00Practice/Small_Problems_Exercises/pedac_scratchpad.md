# PROBLEM
Write a method that combines two Arrays passed in as arguments, and returns a new Array that contains all elements from both Array arguments, with the elements taken in alternation.

You may assume that both input Arrays are non-empty, and that they have the same number of elements.

  Input: two arrays
    - arrays are not empty
    - both arrays have the same number of elements
    - elements may be of different types (e.g. integers and strings)

  Output: array
    - contains all elements from both input arrays
    - elements are in alternating order
    - first element is from the first array, second is from the second, etc.
    - 0 & even-numbered indexed elements are from first array
    - odd-numbered indexed elements are form second array

  ## Rules
  ### explicit
  
  ### implicit


  ## Questions


# EXAMPLES
interleave([1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b', 'c']) == [1, 'a', 2, 'b', 3, 'c']

# DATA STRUCTURES
input: two arrays

array to alternately add elements to

output: array

# ALGORITHM
- create an output array
- iterate over a range: 0 to (array1.size - 1)
  - on each iteration add element at current index from both input arrays to output array 
- return output array
