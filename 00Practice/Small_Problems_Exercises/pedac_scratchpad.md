# PROBLEM
The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers starting with 1 and 1 where each number is the sum of the two previous numbers: the 3rd Fibonacci number is 1 + 1 = 2, the 4th is 1 + 2 = 3, the 5th is 2 + 3 = 5, and so on. In mathematical terms:

  F(1) = 1
  F(2) = 1
  F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2) where n > 2

Write a recursive method that computes the nth Fibonacci number, where nth is an argument to the method.
