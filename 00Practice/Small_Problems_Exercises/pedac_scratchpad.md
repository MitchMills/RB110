# PROBLEM
Write a method that takes two arguments: the first is the starting number, and the second is the ending number. Print out all numbers from the starting number to the ending number, except if a number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz", if a number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz", and finally if a number is divisible by 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

- input: two integers
  - first represents starting number
  - second represents ending number (inclusive)

- output: string
 - all numbers from starting number to ending number (inclusive)
  - if number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead
  - if number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz" instead
  - if number is divisible by 3 AND 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead

# EXAMPLES
fizzbuzz(1, 15) # -> 1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz

3, 6, 9, 12, 15
5, 10, 15
15
