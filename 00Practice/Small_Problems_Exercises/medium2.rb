### 2 ABCs
=begin
A collection of spelling blocks has two letters per block, as shown in this list:

B:O   X:K   D:Q   C:P   N:A
G:T   R:E   F:S   J:W   H:U
V:I   L:Y   Z:M

'boxkdqcpnagtrefsjwhuvilyzm'

This limits the words you can spell with the blocks to just those words that do not use both letters from any given block. Each letter in each block can only be used once.

Write a method that returns true if the word passed in as an argument can be spelled from this set of blocks, false otherwise.

PROBLEM
input: string
  - contains only alpha characters
    - upper and lower case
output: boolean
  - true if string can be constructed from 'blocks', false otherwise
    - each block contains two characters (one on each side)
      - a particular block can only be used once
        - therefore no repeats of the same letter
        - if letter on one side of a block has been used, letter on other side cannot be
  - case insensitive
    - e.g. 'b' == 'B'

EXAMPLES

DATA STRUCTURES
-needs:
  - a way to represent the blocks
  - a way to determine if a particular block has been used

- input: string
  - array to represent blocks
    - each element is a two letter string # ['bo', 'xk', 'dq', . . .]
  - array of each letter in downcased input string # ['b', 'a', 't', 'c', 'h']
  - count of how many times each element in blocks array includes each letter in input string
- output: boolean
  - false if count is greater than 1 for any block

ALGORITHM
- create a representation of the blocks
  - array of thirteen elements
    - each element is a two-letter string
- determine how many times each block is used to create the input string
  - for each block in blocks array
    - consider each letter in input string
    - if letter occurs in that block, increase count by 1
- return false if any block is used more than once, true otherwise
=end

BLOCKS = %w(bo xk dq cp na gt re fs jw hu vi ly zm)

def block_word?(word)
  letters = word.downcase.chars
  counts = BLOCKS.map do |block|
    letters.count { |letter| block.include?(letter) }
  end
  counts.all? { |count| count < 2 }
end

p block_word?('BATCH') #== true
p block_word?('BUTCH') #== false
p block_word?('jest') #== true
p block_word?('apple') #== false
p block_word?('Baby') #== false


### 1 LONGEST SENTENCE
=begin
Write a program that reads the content of a text file and then prints the longest sentence in the file based on number of words. Sentences may end with periods (.), exclamation points (!), or question marks (?). Any sequence of characters that are not spaces or sentence-ending characters should be treated as a word. You should also print the number of words in the longest sentence.

The longest sentence in the below text is the last sentence; it is 86 words long. (Note that each '--' counts as a word.)

Another Example

Download the book at http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/84/pg84.txt, and run your program on this file.

The longest sentence in this book is 157 words long.

Hint: f you have a variable str that contains a bunch of sentences, you can split into an array of sentences like this:

  sentences = text.split(/\.|\?|!/)

PROBLEM
input: string (text file)
  - contains sentences
    - sentence: string that ends with  . ! ?
      - word: sequence of contiguous non-space, non-sentence-ending characters

output: string, integer
  - string is longest sentence of input string
    - longest = greatest number of words
  - integer is number of words in that sentence

needs:
- way to divide text into sentences
- way to determine longest sentence
  - way to count number of words in each sentence

EXAMPLES

DATA STRUCTURES
- input: string
  - array of individual sentences
  - array of individual words in each sentence
- output: string, integer

ALGORITHM
- divide input string into individual sentences
- find the longest sentence
  - divide each sentence into individual words
  - select the sentence with the most words
- output longest sentence to terminal
- output number of words in that sentence to terminal

=end

# def longest_sentence(text)
#   sentences = text.split(/\.|\?|!/)
#   longest = sentences.max_by { |sentence| sentence.split.size }.strip
#   puts longest
#   puts longest.split.size
# end

# def longest_paragraph(text)
#   paragraphs = text.split(/\n\n/)
#   longest = paragraphs.max_by { |paragraph| paragraph.split.size }.strip
#   puts longest
#   puts longest.split.size
# end

# def longest_word(text)
#   words = text.split
#   longest = words.max_by { |word| word.size }
#   puts longest
#   puts longest.size
# end

# text = File.read('frankenstein.txt')

# text = "Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.

# Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.

# But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate, we can not consecrate, we can not hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth."
